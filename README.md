## Important (and good to know):
* To ensure proper application work, do not use Spx Call Recorder in conjunction with other call recorder application.
* Some devices and Android versions do not support call recording. Enabling "Turn on speaker" option from application "Settings" (which will automatically turn on speaker on recording start) or turning speaker on manually can reroute correspondent audio to your device microphone and fix this issue.
